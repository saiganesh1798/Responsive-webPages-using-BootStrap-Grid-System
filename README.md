A responsive webpage is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.
Bootstrap's grid system is a powerful tool that simplifies this process.

**Core Concepts:**

Grid System:

It's a 12-column grid that divides the page into rows and columns.
You can create layouts by specifying the number of columns an element should span.
Bootstrap provides classes to define column widths for different screen sizes:
xs (extra small): <576px
sm (small): ≥576px
md (medium): ≥768px
lg (large): ≥992px
xl (extra large): ≥1200px

Responsive Classes:

These classes help you control the visibility and layout of elements based on screen size.
